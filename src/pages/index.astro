	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">The idea behind this website</h2>
	<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">I'm a passionate nerd with a keen interest in solving problems through technology. My journey has led me to explore various fields, including software development, system administration, and creative problem-solving.<br>
		I am new to the world of development. Currently working in the managed services field; I spend more time troubleshooting issues and making sure things run smoothly for end users. But! I am eager to continue to learn new skills in my development journey and hope to share them progressively on this website<br>
		This website serves as a platform to showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and connect with like-minded individuals. I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I hope to contribute to the tech community through this space.<br>
		Feel free to explore my projects, read my blog posts, and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always open to learning new things and collaborating with others.
