            My name is Caleb, I'm 23 years old, and I live in Australia. I am currently studying my Masters of Cyber Security and Network Administration at Charles Sturt University.

            I have a passion for technology and problem-solving, and love to learn new things. I have experience in various fields, with my current role being in managed services, focusing on Enterprise Mobility Management, where I spend most of my time troubleshooting issues and ensuring smooth operations for end users.
            This can include anything from setting up new devices, to troubleshooting issues with existing devices, to ensuring that all devices are compliant with company policies and procedures. I have experience with a variety of tools and technologies, including Microsoft Intune, Azure Active Directory, and various mobile device management solutions.

            In terms of development, I am still relatively new to the field, but I am eager to learn and grow my skills. I have some small experience with various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and HTML (Fight me, I include this as a programming language ðŸ˜†), and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

            The first of my major projects is this website, which I built using Astro as the framework and Tailwind CSS for styling. I am still learning and growing my skills, but I hope to continue to improve and add new features to this website as I go.
