This is my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you. I'll be writing about a variety of topics, including web development, homelab, and other tech-related things.

## My Homelab

I have a small homelab that I use for testing and learning. It's a great way to try out new technologies without having to worry about breaking anything. I'm currently running a few virtual machines on a Proxmox server. I have a few services running, including:

* **AdGuard:** A network-wide ad blocker.
* **Home Assistant:** A home automation platform.
* **Plex:** A media server.
* **Homarr:** Dashboard with many integrations into other self-hosted systems
* **And plenty more!**

I'm always looking for new things to add to my homelab. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## What's next?

I'm planning on writing more blog posts soon. I'm also working on a few projects that I'm excited to share with you. Stay tuned for more updates!
