# My Personal Website: A Digital Garden and Occasional Dumpster Fire

Welcome to the codebase for my personal corner of the internet. This project is part portfolio, part blog, and part evidence that I sometimes have too much free time.

This site is in a perpetual state of "under construction," much like my understanding of the universe. As I learn new things, I'll bolt them on here. Some will work, some will break, and some will be quietly removed in the middle of the night. For now, enjoy my not-so-basic-anymore website! üòÜ

## üöÄ The Tech Stack (aka The Ingredients)

This whole shebang is held together with digital duct tape and the following technologies:

### Astro JS

Because who doesn't love a framework that aims to ship as little JavaScript as possible? It makes the site fast, and makes me feel smart.

### Tailwind CSS

For making things look pretty without me having to remember what `align-items` does. It's like having a designer friend who only speaks in utility classes.

## The Origin Story

This project initially started as a neat Astro Boilerplate. I've since performed open-heart surgery on it, removing most of the original parts and replacing them with my own custom-built components. It's called learning, and it's messy.

You might find bugs. You might find half-finished pages. You might even question my life choices based on my code. Consider it all part of the charm.

## Who's the guy behind the curtain?

That would be me, Caleb. I'm a 23-year-old IT professional from the land down under (Australia üê®). I'm currently wrestling with a Masters in Cyber Security and Network Administration, so if this website suddenly gets replaced with a terminal window, you'll know I've either been hacked or I'm studying.
